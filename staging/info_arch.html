		<h2>Questions from bottom-up session</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Can you commission work from client?</li>
			<li>How much do his albums, artwork, etc. cost?</li>
			<li>Where can I find shows, events he is participating in?</li>
			<li>Is his work well known?</li>
			<li>What does his music sound like? Genre?</li>
			<li>What kind of videos does he make?</li>
			<li>What kind of art does he make?</li>
			<li>Does he have themes for his art?</li>
			<li>Is his art displayed anywhere in Seattle?</li>
			<li>How can I book his band(s)?</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Process of analyzing questions</h2>
		<p>Dividing my client’s work into individual pages for music, video, visual makes the most sense so I can display his work without overwhelming the user. It also allows me to go into further description about each faucet of his art in a succinct way (history of projects, inspiration, upcoming events, press releases).</p><br> 

		<p>The question of buying his art, albums, videos gave me the choice of either creating a ‘Store’ page for all objects on sale or divide the store items on their corresponding pages. After talking to the client we are in agreement to outsource all shopping to his other, more focused sites and provide links to the items in the appropriate pages.</p><br>

		<p>Upcoming shows/events is something the client and I are not sure how to approach, as he currently does not have events for his visual and video art. This may change in the future and we may need to accommodate a heavy schedule but as it stands we’ll post events on their corresponding page and possibly his blog.</p><br>

		<p>Contacting the client about commissioning, purchasing, and booking will be done through his email, which is displayed on all pages in the header/footer. </p><br>
